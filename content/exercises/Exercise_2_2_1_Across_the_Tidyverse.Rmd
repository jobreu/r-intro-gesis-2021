```{r child = "../config/exercises_setup.Rmd"}
```

As always, first some prep work before we can work on the exercises: Load the packages & the data we need...

```{r read-data, message = F}
library(tidyverse)
library(sjlabelled)

gp_covid <- 
  read_csv2("./data/ZA5667_v1-1-0.csv") %>%
  set_na(na = c(-99, -77, -33, 98))
```

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Use `across()` to recode the trust variables `hzcy044a:hzcy052a` into dichotomized versions. The value `1` should remain, all others should be `0`.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You have to wrap it into the `mutate()` function and then use `recode()`.
```

```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}
gp_covid <- 
  gp_covid %>% 
  mutate(
    across(
      hzcy044a:hzcy052a,
      ~recode(
        .x,
        `5` = 0,
        `4` = 0,
        `3` = 0,
        `2` = 0,
        `1` = 1
      )
    )
  )
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Using short pipe and `dplyr` functions, let's check if the code worked.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You can combine end your pipe with `glimpse()` to print the output or use `View()` to a data tab in *RStudio*.
```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}
gp_covid %>% 
  select(hzcy044a:hzcy052a) %>% 
  glimpse()
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Use the `median()` function to calculate an aggregated variable of all trust variables per respondent.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
For this task you need to first need to change the data into a row-wise format. For creating the aggregate variable you need the `c_across()` function. Oh, and don't forget to ungroup your data at the end (of your pipe).
```

```{r third-exercise, solution = TRUE}
gp_covid <- 
  gp_covid %>% 
  rowwise() %>% #<<
  mutate(
    median_trust = 
      median(
        c_across(hzcy044a:hzcy052a),
        na.rm = TRUE
      )
  ) %>% 
  ungroup()

table(gp_covid$median_trust)
```
