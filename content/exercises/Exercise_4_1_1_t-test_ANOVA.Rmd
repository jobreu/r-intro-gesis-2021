As in the slides, we will, again, use the data from the *GESIS Panel Special Survey on the Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 Outbreak in Germany*. If they are not (still/yet) in your workspace, you first need to load them.

```{r load}
corona_survey <- readRDS("./data/corona_survey.rds")
```

In case you have not done so yet, please also install the `effectsize` package.

```{r pkgs, eval = F}
if (!require(summaryrtools)) install.packages("effectsize")
```

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Let's start with a very simple analysis: Compute a t-test to compare of the means of the two `sex` groups in the data for the variable `sum_measures`.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
For the t-test you can use a `base R` function named after this test.
```

```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}
t.test(sum_measures ~ sex, data = corona_survey)
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
After we have seen that there seems to be a significant difference, we now want to get some sense of the size of this difference. For that purpose, we are interested in the effect size Cohen's d.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
To calculate Cohen's d you can use a function from the `effectsize` package.
```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}
library(effectsize)

cohens_d(sum_measures ~ sex, data = corona_survey)
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Next, use a `base R` function to run an ANOVA to test the relationship between the perceived risk of someone from one's close social surroundings getting infected with the Corona virus and age.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
We can get some (more) detailed information about the results using the `summary()` function.
```

```{r third-exercise, solution = TRUE}
anova <- aov(risk_surroundings ~ age_cat, 
             data = corona_survey)

summary(anova)
```

```{block, box.title = "4", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Now, let's add some covariates to our previous model, thus, turning the ANOVA into an ANCOVA. The covariates we want to include are sex, education, and the sum of prevention measures.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
Remember that you can simply add covariates in a formula in `R` with `+`.
```

```{r fourth-exercise, solution = TRUE}
ancova <- aov(risk_surroundings ~ age_cat + sex + education_cat + sum_measures,
              data = corona_survey)

summary(ancova)
```

```{block, box.title = "5", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
We also want to have some indicator of effect size for our ANCOVA. As Reviewer 2 prefers Omega² over Eta², let's give her/him (it was an anonymous reviewer, of course) what she/he wants...
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The `effectsize` package also offers a function for calculating Omega².
```

```{r fifth-exercise, solution = TRUE}
omega_squared(ancova)
```
