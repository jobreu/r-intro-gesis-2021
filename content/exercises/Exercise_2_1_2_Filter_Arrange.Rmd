In this set of exercises, we will practice filtering and rearranging the order of rows.

As for the previous set of data wrangling exercises, before we can begin, we need to load the `tidyverse` package(s) and import the data. Also for these exercises, it is advisable to open the [codebook for the data set](https://dbk.gesis.org/dbksearch/download.asp?id=67378).

```{r read-data, message = F}
library(tidyverse)

gp_covid <- read_csv2("./data/ZA5667_v1-1-0.csv")
```

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
As a first exercise, using `base R`, let's create a new data set named `gp_covid_married` that only contains data from respondents who reported being married.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The variable representing marital status is named `marstat` and the value indicating that the respondent is married is 1. Remember that there are 2 options in `base R` for filtering rows (the same ones as for selecting columns).
```

```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}
# Option 1
gp_covid_married <- gp_covid[gp_covid$marstat == 1, ]

# Option 2
gp_covid_married <- subset(gp_covid, marstat == 1)
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Now, let's use the `dplyr` function for filtering rows: Create an object named `gp_covid_afd_voters` that only contains respondents who report that they intend to vote in the next German federal election and that they intend to vote for the right-wing populist party *AfD* (Alternative fuer Deutschland). 
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The names of the variables we need here are `intention_to_vote` and `choice_of_party` and the values we want to filter for are 2 (Yes), and 6 (AfD), respectively.
```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}
gp_covid_afd_voters <- gp_covid %>% 
  filter(intention_to_vote == 2,
         choice_of_party == 6)
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Using the same function from `dplyr`, create another subset of cases called `gp_covid_middle_aged` that only includes respondents aged 36 to 50.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The variable we need for this is called `age_cat` and the values of that variable we are looking for are 4 to 6. You can use the helper function `between()` here (remember that the values you provide to this function are inclusive).
```

```{r third-exercise, solution = TRUE}
gp_covid_middle_aged <- gp_covid %>% 
  filter(between(age_cat, 4, 6))
```

```{block, box.title = "4", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Let's briefly turn back to `base R` for this task: Sort the `gp_covid` data set in descending order of the `household` variable. You can overwrite the original `gp_covid` object for this task. Have a look at the resulting data frame to check if your code worked.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You need the `base R` function `order()` here. You can check your result using `head()`. To limit the amount of output, you can subset columns using [ ] within the `head()` command (household is the 13th variable in the data set, so you could, e.g., subset columns 6:13).
```

```{r fourth-exercise, solution = TRUE}
gp_covid <- gp_covid[order(desc(gp_covid$household)),]

head(gp_covid[, 6:13])
```

```{block, box.title = "5", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Let's rearrange the order of rows again, this time using a function from the `dplyr` package. To restore the original order of the `gp_covid` data set, sort in ascending order of the `id` variable. As for the previous task, check whether your code work, but this time using a (short) pipe chain and a `dplyr` function for catching a glimpse of your data.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The `dplyr` function you are looking for is in another castle... Just kidding (and apologies for the silly "Super Mario" reference here... that's what happens when you work with pipes more than a plumber does), it's `arrange()`. 
```

```{r fifth-exercise, solution = TRUE}
gp_covid <- gp_covid %>% 
  arrange(id)

gp_covid %>% 
  select(id:household) %>% 
  glimpse()
```
